# Assignment  
## Technical Assessment: MP3 File Analysis App

---

## Objective

The aim of this task is to create an API endpoint according to the specification below that accepts an MP3 file and responds with the number of frames in the file. A sample file is provided for candidates to test their solution against.

This assessment will test the candidate's ability to:

- Learn & apply new knowledge in a likely unfamiliar context  
- Demonstrate technical competency in TypeScript  
- Show personal coding styles & preferences  

---

## API Specification

- The application must host an endpoint at `/file-upload` that accepts an MP3 file upload via the `POST` method.
- The endpoint must successfully count the number of frames for **MPEG Version 1 Audio Layer 3** files (this is almost universally the format for `.mp3` files, including the provided sample).

> ⚠️ Handling of other MPEG file formats should be considered out of scope for this exercise & candidates are encouraged not to spend time on this.

- The endpoint must provide a JSON response (with the correct response headers) in the following format:

```json
{
  "frameCount": <number>
}

Note: <number> should be the correct number of frames in the MP3 file.

Requirements

The candidate:

Must use TypeScript to complete the exercise.

Must parse the MP3 file to logically count the number of frames in the file.

Must not use an NPM package to parse the MP3 frame data directly.

NPM packages may be used for other purposes such as generic utilities or an HTTP framework.

Must respond to the client with the correct number of frames found in the file, in the format specified above.

Evaluation Criteria

The candidate's solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness

Does the solution meet the requirements?

Does the solution correctly determine the number of frames in the MP3 file?

Does the solution handle errors appropriately?

Code Quality

Is the code well-organised, readable, and maintainable?

Does the code follow TypeScript best practices?

Does the code utilise TypeScript features effectively?

Does the solution include standardised tooling for formatting, linting, testing, etc.?

Error Handling

Is error handling implemented appropriately?

Does the solution handle errors gracefully?

Does the solution provide useful error messages to the user?

Scalability

Is the solution scalable and able to handle large files?

Is the solution optimised for performance?

Approach

Has the candidate used Git effectively?

Is there evidence of a structured approach to the solution?

Tips

The candidate may wish to use a tool such as mediainfo to verify their results.

For macOS users, mediainfo can be installed via Homebrew:

brew install --cask mediainfo

You can scan the file using the following command:

mediainfo --fullscan ~/Desktop/sample.mp3

Candidates are reminded to test final solutions before submission.

Priority should be given to producing a working solution in the allotted time — done is better than perfect.

Brief comments may be left to explain optimisations or improvements that would be implemented with more time.

There will be an opportunity to expand on this at interview.

Candidates may use AI assistance to complete the exercise, but the submission will still be taken as the candidate's own work and should be representative of something they would write themselves. Candidates will be expected to understand and explain the solution.

Submission

The candidate should provide the solution as a Git repository.

The repository should include:

Clear instructions for running the application

An example of how to test the application

Timeframe

The candidate should aim to complete the assessment within 5 days of receiving the task.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your solution.
